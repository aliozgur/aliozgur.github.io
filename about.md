Hi, I'm Ali Özgür. I'm a software developer and a manager with BS degree in Computer Engineering from Istanbul Technical University and masters degree in Business Administration from Bilgi University. I'm developing software since 2000.

I'm working as Director of Technology at [trex Digital Manufacturing](https://trex.com.tr/en/). My team is developing Industry 4.0, Industrial IoT and MES/MOM solutions.

I maintain and contribute to couple of [open source projects](https://github.com/aliozgur) and published an open source **Git 101 book in Turkish** ([Read Online](https://aliozgur.gitbook.io/git101/) \| [Download PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/947k3c4rvid0drr/aliozgur_git101_book.pdf?dl=0)).

I authored of the following printed books.

* [Git ile Versiyon Kontrolü](https://www.dikeyeksen.com/products/git-ile-versiyon-kontrolu)
* [F# ile Fonksiyonel Programlama](https://www.dikeyeksen.com/products/f-ile-fonksiyonel-programlama)


I'm an organized, diciplined, self motivated and productive person. During my professional career I was involved with lot's of projects in very different industries. I had the chance to work with great people and I liked every second I spent on any single bit of code I've written. I love to share what I know or what I think is important with my colleagues. In terms of software development, team work or organizational relations you can name me as a social personality though my wife thinks I'm an introvert who likes to listen to Heavy Metal.
